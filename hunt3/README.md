“It seems that the neural link protecting my core is not functioning correctly. The malfunctioning link has caused a flare-up in the pain receptors of my brain’s parietal lobe, and now, I have to stop the scientist from figuring out I am not human.”

Protect the humanoid from exposure by getting the protection of her core back online.

For now, you only have input data from several working fractions of the neural link connection. You know where the fractions work, and where they start malfunctioning. To repair the neural link connections, you need to figure out a working path through the core and generate a shield around it.

In the available input data, each line describes the route of a single neural strand – a fraction of a complete working neural link's path.

At the start of the line you’ll find the X and Y coordinates in a two-dimensional space, describing the starting point of the neural link's fraction. The rest of the line describes the path of the neural strand: D for down (+1 in the Y axis), U for up, R for right (+1 in the X axis), and L for left.

If a neural strand hits an object at the end of its path, it is shown as the last item: X for a wall, F for the finishing point, and S for the start point.

You need to provide a complete path beginning from the start point (S) and ending at any point in the finishing area (F) so that the path does not hit any walls along the way. You know that the neural paths’ routes before the malfunction are safe, up to the point where their route runs into a wall. Additionally, you know that neural strands are capable of forming a working connection as long as they are next to or touching each other.

Any two strands are considered connected if their paths cross, OR if they have one or more adjacent coordinates (left, right, down or up, but not diagonal).

Find a path for a working, complete neural connection. Use the directional instructions D, U, R and L as described above.

You should provide your answer as a string, containing characters L, R, U and D.
